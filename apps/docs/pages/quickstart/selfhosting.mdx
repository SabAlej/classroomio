# Self hosting with Docker

### Prerequisites

- Have Docker installed on your machine. 
  If not, you can download the right option for your OS from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- Have Docker Compose installed on your machine. It comes pre-installed with Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac. 
  For Linux users, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).


### Steps

1. Fork this repository.

2. Clone the forked project repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<github-account>/classroomio.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory or change your current directory to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd classroomio
   ```

4. Build and run the Docker services: Use Docker Compose to build and run the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

   ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
   ```


This command will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. 

These services include:

   - **classroomio-com**: This service runs the ClassroomIO application. It is accessible on port 3001 of your localhost.
   - **dashboard**: This service runs the Dashboard application. It is accessible on port 3002 of your localhost.
   - **supabase**: This service runs a Supabase Postgres database. It is accessible on ports `54321`, `54323`, and `54324` of your *localhost*.


Access the applications

You can now access the ClassroomIO application at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and the Dashboard application at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

Note
The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` environment variables in the `docker-compose.yaml` file are placeholders. Replace them with your actual Supabase keys and JWT secret for the services to function correctly.
